Ski Resort Recommendation System Leveraging Data Mining

Team Members: Juncheng Man, Justin Nguyen, Grace Waida, and Audrey Ly

Project Goal: Develop a Ski Resort Recommendation System that helps skiers identify the best ski resorts in the United States based on their preferences. ​

Project Description: Generate insights from ski resorts data to assist skiers and snowboarders who are planning a trip to a ski resort in the United States in choosing a ski resort most aligned with their preferences. Data insights are generated for a range of factors that skiers may consider when selecting a ski resort: such as snowfall, ticket prices, location, difficulty of runs, and weather conditions. ​
